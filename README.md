# Nicotine+

Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/)
peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a lightweight, pleasant, free and open source (FOSS)
alternative to the official Soulseek client, while also providing a
comprehensive set of features.

Nicotine+ is written in Python and uses GTK for its graphical user interface.

Check out the [screenshots](data/screenshots/SCREENSHOTS.md)
and [source code](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus).


## Features

### ðŸŽµ Preview/Listen Feature

Nicotine+ includes an integrated preview system that allows you to listen to audio files and watch video files directly from the download interface, without waiting for the complete download to finish.

**Key Features:**
- **Integrated Player**: Built-in media player using GStreamer for seamless playback
- **External Player Support**: Automatic fallback to your system's default media player
- **Wide Format Support**: MP3, FLAC, OGG, WAV, M4A, AAC, WMA, Opus, AIFF (audio) + MP4, AVI, MKV, WebM, MOV (video)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with automatic dependency detection
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Automatically adapts to available multimedia capabilities on your system

The preview system automatically detects and configures multimedia dependencies, providing the best possible experience without manual setup.

### Installation for Preview Support

#### Windows
Nicotine+ automatically detects GStreamer installations. Choose one of these methods:

```bash
# Option 1: MSYS2 Environment (Recommended for developers)
# First install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
# Then in MSYS2 terminal:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-good

# Option 2: Chocolatey Package Manager
# First install Chocolatey from https://chocolatey.org/
choco install gstreamer

# Option 3: Official GStreamer Installer (Easiest for end users)
# Download from: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/
# Run the .msi installer and follow the wizard
```

#### macOS
Install GStreamer via Homebrew for full preview support:

```bash
# Intel Macs
brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly

# Apple Silicon Macs (recommended path)
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly
```

#### Linux
Most distributions include GStreamer by default. If needed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-ugly

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly
```

**Note**: If multimedia dependencies are not available, Nicotine+ will automatically fall back to using your system's default media player for previews.

## Where did the name Nicotine come from?

I stumbled across this quote:  
>> **\<etc>** so tempting to release a product called 'nicotine' and wait for
>> the patches.  
>> **\<etc>** then i would have a reason to only apply one patch a day.
>> otherwise, i'm going against medical advise.

> So I thought what the hell and bluntly stole etc's idea.
